# Image_Caption_Generator_Regional_Languages


Image Caption Generator in Regional Languages Source Code
• An AI model that assists users in generating captions for images in regional languages such as Hindi and Odia using large language models (LLMs) with a BLEU score of 34.
• Pre-trained CNN model ResNet is used as encoder for image feature extraction and a pre-trained language model BERT and ELECTRA is used for generating texts based on semantics and context. After this sequence to sequence LSTM model is used as decoder for effective caption generation.
• Tech Used: Python, LLM, Bert, Deep Learning, CNN, LSTM, Tensorflow
